## 6. TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF

6.1. A Big Mistake

When the interviewer says, **"Please tell me about yourself,"** many people mention only their name, where they are coming from, and where they have studied. This information is very basic, and the interviewer already knows from your CV. So, that’s wasting an opportunity.

6.2. Topics you should cover

Usually, the first real question asked during an interview is, "Please tell me about yourself," or "Please introduce yourself."

> You should do the following:

- Don’t just tell your name, where you studied and this type of basic information
- Tell in a way so that it matches the job description
- Tell your impact on the team, on the project, on the company
- Tell your achievements
- You can also tell those which are not mentioned in the Job description.

## 13. SALARY NEGOTIATION

13.1.3. The Unknowns while Salary negotiation
> Question
- I don’t know what is going on
- Is there a better candidate than me who wanted less salary?
- What is their budget?
> Answer
- I don’t want to tell them how much salary I want until they offer me.
- If they give me pressure, I give a wide range, e.g., 50k-80k, which should fall into their budget and allows me to negotiate later on.
- Once they make an offer, I know there is more on the table because the initial offer is always lower than what they can pay maximum.

## 13.7. Negotiation steps

13.7.1. Steps:
1. First, mention what you bring to the table. E.g.
- Your **skill set**
- Your **Experience**
- Your **motivation**
- You are a **quick learner**
- You are considering to stay in this job for a long period of time as it matches with your carrier trajectory

2. Then ask politely:
- "Given all of those, is it possible to increase the salary by X thousand?"

> Here is an example:

"I’ve done similar work before, and I know a lot about the things you need. I have the required skill set, which means I’ll be more efficient and effective.

13.7.2. When you need more time

> usually respond like this when I need more time:

"Thanks for the offer. I need time because I am waiting for other offers. I will then sit with my family and decide on the offers."

> If they give pressure to accept now?

"I need time, and I will come back soon." Tell them approximately when you will come back to them.
