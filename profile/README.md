## 13. SALARY NEGOTIATION

13.1.3. The Unknowns while Salary negotiation
> Question
- I don’t know what is going on
- Is there a better candidate than me who wanted less salary?
- What is their budget?
> Answer
- I don’t want to tell them how much salary I want until they offer me.
- If they give me pressure, I give a wide range, e.g., 50k-80k, which should fall into their budget and allows me to negotiate later on.
- Once they make an offer, I know there is more on the table because the initial offer is always lower than what they can pay maximum.

## 13.7. Negotiation steps

13.7.1. Steps:
1. First, mention what you bring to the table. E.g.
- Your **skill set**
- Your **Experience**
- Your **motivation**
- You are a **quick learner**
- You are considering to stay in this job for a long period of time as it matches with your carrier trajectory

2. Then ask politely:
- "Given all of those, is it possible to increase the salary by X thousand?"

> Here is an example:

"I’ve done similar work before, and I know a lot about the things you need. I have the required skill set, which means I’ll be more efficient and effective.

13.7.2. When you need more time

> usually respond like this when I need more time:

"Thanks for the offer. I need time because I am waiting for other offers. I will then sit with my family and decide on the offers."

> If they give pressure to accept now?

"I need time, and I will come back soon." Tell them approximately when you will come back to them.
